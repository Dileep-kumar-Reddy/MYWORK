A Half adder is an exapmle of combinational circuit. Its output is completely dependent on its input at any instant of time.
It is circuit which is capable of adding two bits which also produce two bits of output.
Two input bits are the significant bits to be added which are called augend and addend. The two outputs bits are sum and carry.
The addition of two bits in the situation when two inputs are equal to 1 produce 10 which needs a carry bit to store.
the inputs bits are designed as x and y the output lines are named as S(sum) and C(carry)
Truth table
    x   y   S   C 
    0   0   0   0
    0   1   1   0
    1   0   1   0
    1   1   0   1
As there are two input we can make 4 sets of inputs and outputs.
When one of the input is bit 1 S is set to 1
If both X and Y are 1 Then carry is set to 1
If we can generalize this situation we can get
            S=x+y  -> x OR y
            C=xy   -> x AND Y
